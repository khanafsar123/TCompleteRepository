Type Casting:
	Type casting is converting one data type to another one.
	For example we can convert a short to byte, a long to float etc.
	There are two main types implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/Manual 

Implicit/widening/automatic:
	When java converts the data types automatically for us. It only happens when we assign a smaller data type to a larger data type, 
	because there is no data loss in this conversion.

Explicit/narrowing/Manual:
	When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type it is called Explicit/narrowing/Manual.
	It doesn't happen automatically, we have to do it explicitly/manually.
	
When we should learn type casting?
	When we write code in our real life most of the time we use the code from others to save time and 
	we might also need to convert the data types to make our code compatible with their code.
	
What is the syntax for type casting?
	We use () and inside the () we write the destination data types for example
	if we want to convert a long to an int this is how we do it
	long var1=250;
	int var2=(int)var1; // its explicit/narrowing/Manual 
	double var3=var2    // its Implicit/widening/automatic
	
	float f=250.5f;
	double d=f;         // its Implicit/widening/automatic

If else conditions:
	If else conditions help us write codes that can take the decision based on data.

Why we should learn about if else?
	Because when we are solving a real life problem like resting a Web site, our programs need to make a lot of decisions.
	If (the given username and password matches)
	{go to home page} 
	Else 
	{give user a warning}
	
	
	if(video freezing){
	System.out.println("Stop video")}
	else {System.out.println("Keep video")}
	
What is the syntax for If else conditions?
	boolean isHungry=true;
	
	if(isHungry){
	System.out.println("Please eat something")
	} else {
	System.out.println("Lets build some java program")}
