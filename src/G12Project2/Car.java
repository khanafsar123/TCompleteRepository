    Create a Class Car that would have the following fields: carPrice and color and method calculateSalePrice()

    field as weight and has its own implementation of calculateSalePrice() method in which returned price is
    calculated as following: if weight>2000 then returned price car should include 10% discount, otherwise 20%
    discount. The Sedan class has field as length and also does it is own implementation of calculateSalePrice():
     if length of sedan is >20 feet then returned car price should include 5% discount, otherwise 10% discount
